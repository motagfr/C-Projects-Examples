# Grade Analysis Program

The Grade Analysis program is designed to analyze a set of grades input by the user. It calculates various statistics, including the maximum grade and its frequency, as well as the average grade. This program is useful for educators and students who want to evaluate performance based on grades.

## Features

- **Input Grades**: The program prompts the user to enter a specified number of grades.
- **Calculate Maximum Grade**: It identifies the highest grade entered and counts how many times it appears.
- **Calculate Average Grade**: The program computes the average of all grades entered.
- **Display Results**: After processing, the program displays the maximum grade, its frequency, and the average grade.

## How to Use

1. Compile the program using a C compiler.
2. Run the executable.
3. Follow the prompts to enter the number of grades and the grades themselves.
4. View the results displayed on the screen.

## Example

```
Enter the number of grades: 5
Enter grade 1: 85
Enter grade 2: 90
Enter grade 3: 85
Enter grade 4: 70
Enter grade 5: 90

Maximum grade: 90.00 (appears 2 times)
Average grade: 84.00
```

## Code Explanation

The program consists of a main function that handles user input and calls the necessary functions to perform calculations. The functions include:

- `findt(float a[], int k)`: Analyzes the grades to find the maximum and its frequency.
- Additional helper functions can be added for further analysis if needed.

## Compilation

To compile the program, use the following command:

```
gcc grade_analysis.c -o grade_analysis
```
