# String Operations Example

This directory contains a C program that demonstrates various string manipulation operations. The program includes functions for common string tasks such as reversing a string, converting to uppercase, and finding the length of a string.

## Files

- `string_operations.c`: This file contains the implementation of the string manipulation functions along with a main function that demonstrates their usage.

## Functions Implemented

1. **Reverse a String**: This function takes a string as input and returns the reversed version of that string.

2. **Convert to Uppercase**: This function converts all lowercase letters in a string to uppercase.

3. **Find Length of a String**: This function calculates and returns the length of a given string.

## How to Use

1. Compile the program using a C compiler:
   ```
   gcc string_operations.c -o string_operations
   ```

2. Run the compiled program:
   ```
   ./string_operations
   ```

3. Follow the prompts to enter a string and see the results of the various operations.

## Example

```
Enter a string: hello
Reversed string: olleh
Uppercase string: HELLO
Length of string: 5
```

## Notes

- Ensure that you have a C compiler installed on your system to compile and run the program.
- The program handles basic string operations and can be extended with additional functionality as needed.
